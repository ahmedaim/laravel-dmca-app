# laravel-dmca-app
Before I take on construction of a custom Laravel app, I thought I would learn Laravel 5. I know I am competent with Laravel 4.2, but I see there are significant changes in structure compared to Laravel 5. This is from Jeffrey Way's Laravel 5 tutorial at https://laracasts.com/series/build-your-first-app-in-laravel.
